            <h4>Identify the Problem</h4>
            <p>
                The Gale Support Site is a valuable resource intended to help users, particularly teachers, engage with Gale products through self-guided support. However, Gale was running into issues with their website navigation and architecture, as teachers, with limited time, often felt overwhelmed by the volume of content. Cengage Learning was seeking web assessment to better understand how customers can access content more efficiently on its Gale Support Site.
                <br />
                The core challenge was to redesign the site to meet the needs of teachers, allowing them to quickly find actionable resources for immediate classroom use. By examining the site content, navigation, and user feedback, we aimed to eliminate preconceived assumptions and create an intuitive experience that aligns with user expectations.
                <br />
                How can we utilize navigation and information architecture to help users become more efficient in finding what they need?

                    <p>39 years old</p>
                    <p>9th Grade History Teacher</p>
                    <p>Philadelphia, PA</p>
                    <p>Jane has been a 9th grade teacher for 2 years now, but also worked in the public library system and as a middle school teacher. Jane uses different resources in her teaching and also in her lesson plans. She tries to tailor her teaching to what her students need and also create an engaging learning environment. She tries to plan her lessons a month in advance to allow for adjustments to be made as needed based on how her students are doing. Jane has the responsibility of teaching full time and creating lesson plans, and she also serves on a teaching committee within the school, meaning she is very busy and does not have much extra time she can spend searching for teaching materials and resources. </p>
                    <h5>Needs</h5>
                    <p>
                        Jane needs to locate teaching materials and activities for students and for her lesson plan. She would like a quick and easy way to find and organize activities that she uses frequently, as well as customizable resources and tools that are intuitive.</p>

            <p>Our process consisted of reviewing interview notes, qualitative analysis using the affinity wall technique (Appendix E), team members individually coded interviews, transferring insights to FigJam for visualization, and anonymized participants as "UI-01, UI-02," etc. We reviewed the notes for accuracy, and then collaboratively grouped them by emerging themes.

                <p>Leveraging Nielsens 10 usability heuristics, we evaluated the site to identify areas of concern in terms of usability. Our team members individually conducted our heuristic evaluations before coming together to consolidate our findings into a more condensed list of issues to address. </p>
                <p> We have identified the following issues:</p>
                <ul class="heuristic-list">
                    <li> Inconsistent page titles and navigation elements.</li>
                    <li>The absence of both search bar features on homepages and back arrows causes difficulty when users try to freely navigate the site.
                    </li>
                    <li>Elements such as selectable links in sub-page headings and copy-able text lack clear affordance. </li>
                    <li>Website accessibility concerns.</li>
                    <li>Issues like overwhelming hover box content, unclear icon labels, and poor readability from small text and unclear imagery cause strain on the user.

            <div class="findings-txt">
                <p>We were able to find three major takeaways regarding site usability, and provide recommendations for improving the site information architecture and UX to the client based off of these findings.</p>
                    <ul class="findings-list">
                        <li> The current navigation is unclear to users</li>

                    <li>Continuing Research:

                        Implementation of survey to gather larger sample size of participants

                        <li>Continuing Learning:
                            Further education on quantitative research methods to implement that may be beneficial in anchoring recommendations in numbers to propagate understanding between other stakeholders
